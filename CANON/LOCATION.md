## Sensory Environment

### Sounds
- Morning: Monks chanting from nearby wat, motorbikes starting, roosters, the call of "soup, soup" from street vendors
- Afternoon: AC units humming, tuk-tuks honking, construction noise, tourists negotiating
- Night: Bass from the bar, drunk conversations in multiple languages, distant karaoke, motorbikes, the occasional scream of delight from the pool table
- Unique sounds: The particular rattle of the hostel's ancient AC, the creak of the colonial stairs

### Smells
- Hostel: Cheap disinfectant barely masking mold, stale beer from the bar, someone cooking instant noodles, sunscreen
- Street: Prahok (fermented fish), exhaust fumes, frangipani flowers, open sewers, grilling meat
- Specific to death location: Musty dorm smell, Damien's cologne lingering, the chemical edge of the drugged drink

### Textures
- Surfaces: Sticky bar top, gritty tile floors, peeling paint, rough cotton sheets
- Climate feel: Oppressive humidity that makes everything slightly damp, sweat that never dries

### Tastes
- Local food: Fish amok, lok lak, num banh chok, fresh fruit smoothies, Angkor beer
- Hostel offerings: Cheap beer ($0.50), basic fried rice, toast and jam breakfast

### Visual Details
- Colors: Faded colonial yellows and blues, bright backpacker graffiti, green mold on walls, neon beer signs
- Light quality: Harsh tropical sun during day, warm yellow bar lights at night, dim fluorescents in dorms
- Distinctive visuals: The ever-growing mural of travelers, Buddha statues repurposed as ashtrays, strings of Christmas lights year-round

## The Staff

### Reception
**Name:** Maly
**Description:** 22-year-old Cambodian woman, exhausted from overnight shifts, speaks excellent English with a flat affect. Has seen too much in this hostel to be surprised by anything.
**Role in death:** Oblivious - checks Damien out at 4 AM without question, assumed Ingrid was just another drunk tourist when helped to her room

### Other Staff
| Role | Name | Notable Trait |
|------|------|---------------|
| Cleaner | Sopheap | Discovers the body, traumatized, devoutly Buddhist |
| Security | None | Cost-cutting measure |
| Bar/Kitchen | Rith | Young guy who flirts with tourists, pours strong drinks, didn't notice anything wrong |
| Manager/Owner | Bruce (Australian) | Only appears when there's a problem, pays bribes efficiently |

### Staff Knowledge
Staff are willfully ignorant. They know bad things happen but don't want to know details. Maly suspects Damien but will never say so. Previous incidents have been hushed up with payments to police and families.

## Hostel Atmosphere

### Day Vibe
Hungover and lazy. Guests sleep until noon, lounge in hammocks, plan temple visits they won't take. Kitchen busy with instant noodles and toast. A few ambitious souls leave early for Killing Fields tours.

### Night Vibe
Transforms completely. The Pit fills up by 8 PM. Cheap beer flows. Travelers compete at pool. Connections are made - some genuine, some predatory. Music gets louder until midnight. The desperate energy of people trying to have the time of their lives.

### Guest Demographics
Mix of:
- Gap year Brits and Aussies
- European backpackers on the circuit
- American study abroad students
- Digital nomads testing the lifestyle
- Older solo travelers escaping something
- Occasional sex tourists (staff tries to discourage)

### Reputation
4.1 stars on HostelWorld - "Amazing bar, great people, rooms are basic but who cares!" Whispered warnings on forums about petty theft and getting "too wasted." Beloved by party travelers, avoided by those seeking peace.
